# Problematic
Problematic is a 2D side-scroller where the goal is to obtain a key and advance to the next level. However, there are many obstacles in the way. If you fall into one of these traps, you must complete a math problem to continue. The project was created by Faizaan Datoo, Willie Hawley, and Alex Cevicelow for the 2015 PA Middle School Computer Fair.
