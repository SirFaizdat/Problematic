# Problematic
Kids are spending more time playing video games than actually doing their homework. I can't think of any kid who would choose math problems over playing a fun video game on their phone. What if we could comebine the video game experience with math practice? Problematic does just that. Problematic is a 2D side-scroller where the goal is to obtain a key and advance to the next level. However, there are many obstacles in the way. If you fall into one of these traps, you must complete a math problem to continue. The project was created by Faizaan Datoo, Willie Hawley, and Alex Cevicelow for the 2015 PA Middle School Computer Fair.
